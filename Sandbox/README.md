# Sandbox Repository

This repository is a **sandbox environment** for testing and prototyping.

**Every time it is compiled (e.g., using the scripts `./all_cmake.sh` or `./module_cmake.sh <module>`),
  the outputs are **redirected** to the `Sandbox/` directory.**
  
* Here, the `.so` files (shared libraries) will be available
  for experimentation, prototyping, and testing purposes.

* The `Resources/` folder contains a collection of publicly accessible files in various formats (.doc, .pdf, .txt), used to test the functionalities of the different loaders. These materials are assumed to be free of patent restrictions or in the public domain.

* `demochunk_VDB.ipynb` is an example notebook demonstrating how to interact with the Vector Database (VDB), showing practical usage and integration patterns. (To open in google colab
